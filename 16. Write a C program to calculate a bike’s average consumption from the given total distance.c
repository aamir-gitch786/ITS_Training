16. Write a C program to calculate a bike’s average consumption from the given total distance (integer value) traveled (in km) and spent fuel (in liters, float number – 2 decimal point).

    Test Data :
    Input total distance in km: 350
    Input total fuel spent in liters: 5
    Expected Output:
    Average consumption (km/lt) 70.000
